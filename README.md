# Ethc-a-Sketch
### This project is a demestoration of DOM and javascrtipt usage
# I started with making a fucntion that loop a random size to make that many div and populate my container 
# after adding my css and using flex-wrap and flexbox to help me wrap them around in my container 
# I also added a button that has a click event listener 
# this button had a function that check for click and let you resize the grid to any layout
# I use math floor to divde the size by what my continer size to make sure they fix
# I also added to diffrente variable that do the same thign in case i want to change the size of my continer in the future 
# as a bonus i added a random number input for my RGB value when the mouse over on the div come i also changed the opacity to make it look more pastel like
